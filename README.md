# Python_API_Challenge-Mod-6

"What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

WeatherPy

In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

VacationPy

In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
